## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced to make a responsive page for mobile and desktop, especially when doing the layout styling for the responsive design. This project doesn't need to use javascript, so I can focus on improving my HTML & CSS skills

### Continued development

I want to improve my skills on the layout styling as close as possible to the design.
